## About The Project

___
## Installation
This project runs in Jupyter Notebook. To use Jupyter Notebook it is necessary to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Once installed, Jupyter Notebook can be accessed through the Anaconda Navigator.

To run the code, the following packages must be installed:
- tkinter
- ttk
- math
- mpmath

These packages can be installed by opening a new terminal in Jupyter Notebook and using the following command:

```pip install [Insert package name here.]```

Where the brackets should be replaced with the package name. For example, to install mpmath enter the command:

```pip install mpmath```

## Acknowledgements
I acknowledge the extensive use of the math and mpmath Python modules in this project and am grateful for the work done by the creators of these packages. Without these libraries this project would have been much harder.

The book Numerical Analysis by Burden & Faires, 9th edition was used as a reference over the course of the project, and I thank the authos of this book which served as a valuable resource.

Furthermore, Wolfram MathWorld allow me to learn about the various special functions I didn't know about prior to this project. I thank the creators of this website, for the material I referred to during this project. As well as serving as a great resource for nearly every area of mathematics

I thank the owner of the YouTube channel Clear Code. His tkinter tutorial helped me learn how to create user interfaces in Python. Including the one for this project.

I thank Liu Zuo Lin for his [Medium article](https://medium.com/codex/another-python-question-that-took-me-days-to-solve-as-a-beginner-37b5e144ecc) on how to evaluate Python strings as mathematical expressions. This helped me avoid the use of the _eval_ and _exec_ functions, which have been shown to be insecure
